## General Information

* Apache Maven is a build automation tool that is based on POM (Project Object Model). It is used primarily for Java projects. It can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages.
* Maven is used for projects build, dependency and documentation. It takes care of the process of including the jar and dependency packages when we want to connect with other entities of the developing environment and it deals with how the software is built.
* Maven is very helpful for a project while updating central repository of JARs and other dependencies.
* Using maven we can easily integrate our project with source control system (such as Subversion or Git).

## What When How
